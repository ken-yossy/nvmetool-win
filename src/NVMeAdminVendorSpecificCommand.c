/**
 *   iNVMeAdminVendorSpecificCommand: FOR REFERENCE ONLY
 *     Sample function for issuing a vendor specific command to NVMe drives
 *
 *   [CAUTION]
 *     To use this function as template, you have to edit some codes as your
 * purpose.
 *
 *     Generally, the specification (behavior, parameters, and outputs) of
 * vendor specific commands are not disclosed to users, it is highly dangerous
 * to issue the command without complete spec of it.
 *
 *     It is confirmed that CDW[10-15] are successfully passed to drives.
 *
 *     You should carefully read and need to understand Microsoft's article:
 *       "Working with NVMe drives"
 * <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/working-with-nvme-devices>
